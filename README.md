# Educational-Chatbot

Used Python to create a simple chabot that answers user questions related to breast cancer (diagnosis, treatment, risk factors). I did this in order to give myself a basic introduction to natural language processing. This project inspired me to begin another project that makes use of deep learning techniques in order to create a more sophisticated chatbot (currently in progress).
