# Simple Educational Chatbot

Used Python to create a simple chabot that answers user questions related to breast cancer (diagnosis, treatment, risk factors). The questions and answers are all 'hard coded'. I did this in order to give myself a basic introduction to natural language processing. I would like to revisit this project one day and build on it by making use of deep learning techniques to create a more sophisticated chatbot.
